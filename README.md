# Overview

Welcome to the world of secure passwords made easy! This Password Generator is here to revolutionize your online security game. Say goodbye to weak and predictable passwords and embrace the strength of randomly generated, virtually uncrackable ones!

What sets this Password Generator apart? Not only does it offer a seamless way to create robust passwords, but it also puts the power in your hands with customizable options. Choose your desired password length and whether you want to include symbols for an extra layer of security.
